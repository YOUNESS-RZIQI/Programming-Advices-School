//   the difference berween Reference (& x) and pointer (*P) is that : pointer has place in the memory but the 
//   refrence is just another name for the same variable "isme dala3e" and if it gaving to some variable we
//   can not gave it to an other one but the pointer we can do that in the run time    :-)
