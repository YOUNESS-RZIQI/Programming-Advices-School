What is a Class ? 

	it is like the string it is a place where you can put the functions that is connect with each other like
dalile alhatif hhh  so that why we need the class , and class came from classification so you classificate the Methods and the Members se you want . So the code well be more structured and more easy , and the only way to access the Class is by the Object it is like the int you can not access to it by it self but you do a variable of type int 
that is the same for Class you do a type of it and that type we call it Object , Object of the Class ?

And when we want to name a class we do Before his name 'cls' like the structure we do 'st' or the Enum we do 'en'


In Class : 

	* by default it is Private
	* it contain Methods (functions) and Members (variables)


Code : 


#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

class clsPersson
{
private:
	int x, y, z;

public:
	string FirstName;
	string LastName;

	string FullName()
	{
		return (FirstName + " " + LastName);
	}
};

int main(void)
{
	clsPersson P;

	P.FirstName = "Youness";
	P.LastName = "Rziqi";

	cout << P.FullName() << endl;

	return 0;
}
