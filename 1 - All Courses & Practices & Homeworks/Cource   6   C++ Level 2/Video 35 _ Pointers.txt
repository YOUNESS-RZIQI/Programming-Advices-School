the pointers is a variable that can have only the address of other variable only nothing else less of more , and the pointer should be the same category of the variable address if int should be int ... 






#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main()
{


	int a = 10;
	int b = 20;

	cout << "a Value is : " << a << "\n\n";
	cout << "a address is : " << &a << "\n\n";


	int * p = &a;


	cout << "p address in a  : " << p << "\n\n" << endl;

	p = &b;

	cout << "b Value is : " << b << "\n\n";
	cout << "b address is : " << &b << "\n\n";


	cout << "p address in b : " << p << "\n\n" << endl;

	cout << "b = " << b << " a = " << a << endl;


	return 0;
