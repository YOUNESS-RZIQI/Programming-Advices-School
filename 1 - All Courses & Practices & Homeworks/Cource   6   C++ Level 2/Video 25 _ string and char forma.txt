in the formatting we can not use string but in the real the string is array of characters so we well use character array as a string :-)  : 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;


int main()
{

	char Name[] = "Youness Rziqi";
	char School[] = "Programming Advices";


	printf("Hi %s .\n", Name);
	printf("You Have been selected to Study in %s School \n\n", School);


	char Num = 'A'; // char Num = 65;

	printf("The example :%c\n", Num);
	printf("The example :%*c\n", 3,  Num);
	printf("The example :%3c\n", Num);



	return 0;
}
