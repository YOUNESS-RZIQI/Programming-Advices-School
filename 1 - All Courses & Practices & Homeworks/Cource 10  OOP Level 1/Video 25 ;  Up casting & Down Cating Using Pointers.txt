						Title :  Up Casting Vs Down Casting in Inheritance 
						
				Notion :  ! ! It is a Data type, so it Can use up/Down casting ! !


		1) * Up Casting : 

				* It is Convirting from the Drived Class to Base Class , and that is Possible .
				* And we can do a Pointer of Base class point to a Drived class , becaus he insure 
				  that all the Methods/Members of the Base class exist in the SubClass , but the vers is Impossible.
				
				
	    2) * Down Casting : 

				* it is Convirting from Base Class to a Drived Calsss , and that is Impossible! .
				


												** In simple way ** 

			* Pointers Casting : look if the data type of the pointer all her Member exist in the Object that
			  will point in to ? In sempil term , it is possible to a base point to a Sube , but the revers NO !!
