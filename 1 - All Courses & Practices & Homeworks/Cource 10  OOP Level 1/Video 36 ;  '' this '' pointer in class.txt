/*

									Title : this pointer in c++



		1) the ckey work "this" inside the class mean that this is the object that you on now.

		2) you can use "this" pointer just inside the class.

		3) why we need the "this" pointer , to lett the compiler know wich is the object's of the class and the argements
			if they have the same name (the example in the parametrized constroctur in line 33).

		4) in "Function1" we have a argement of data type clsEmployee wiht his object and we did not need to gave hem the
		parameterz for the constructor, so we just need that is we are out side of the class.

		5) and in "Function2" we sent "*this" because the "Function1" expect a object not an address so we need "*this" not "this" onlye

		6) When calling Function1, you just pass an object like Function1(Employee1) or, in my case, Function1(*this).

		7) Employee1.Functio1(Employee1) = Function1(*this)
