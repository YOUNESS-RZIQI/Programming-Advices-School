						Title : Separat classes in Libraries


		1) #pragma one : to avoid the problem of more then one including for the library.
		
		2) if you want to creat a clas lib , you go to solution explorer and chose heder files and you cleck on it 
		and you chose add class , then you chose the name for the class and also you chose in line to not make the file .cpp
		i mean C++ code. then congrat you lib is done just put fist #pragma once for avoid the error of duplcat including
		and that is it.

		3) if you want to call your libe you do #include "clsPerson.h" , not #include <clsPerson.h> becaus it is a local
		lib.

#include "clsPerson.h"
#include "clsEmployee.h"
